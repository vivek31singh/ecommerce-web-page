# Project Brief: None

## Project Type
Web Application (Automotive Listing/Showcase Platform)

## Project Goals (Golden Context)
To build a modern, high-performance, and responsive web application for selling cars. The site should allow users to browse an inventory of vehicles, filter results based on criteria (make, price, year), view detailed specifications of specific cars, and initiate contact regarding a purchase. The application must prioritize user experience, fast load times, and mobile responsiveness.

## Complexity
Moderate
Justification: While a basic listing page is simple, a "car selling" platform requires dynamic data handling, filtering logic, responsive grid layouts, and detailed product pages. The use of Next.js Server Components adds a slight learning curve but offers better performance. The inclusion of search/filter logic and a contact form elevates it beyond a static site.

## Tech Stack
Frontend Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
Language: TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Icons: Lucide React
State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
Form Handling: React Hook Form (with Zod validation)
Data Fetching: Next.js Fetch API (Server Components) or SWR for client-side caching
